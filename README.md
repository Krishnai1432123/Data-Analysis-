# 🤖 AI Data Analysis Agent

AI Data Analysis Agent is a professional AI-powered Data Analysis Web Application built using Python and Streamlit. The application enables users to upload CSV datasets and perform interactive data analysis, visualization, filtering, and statistical exploration through an intuitive and modern user interface. Designed to eliminate the need for coding, this platform makes data analysis accessible to beginners, students, and professionals alike. The application is fully web-based and live hosted on Streamlit Cloud, making it easy to access from anywhere.

This project highlights a clean and modern UI enhanced with a premium glassmorphism design and background styling. Users can upload CSV files, preview datasets (top, bottom, or complete view), generate automatic statistical summaries, and apply column-based filtering for focused analysis. The application supports multiple visualization types including Histogram, Line Chart, Bar Chart, and Box Plot, along with a correlation heatmap for deeper analytical insights. Additionally, it provides AI-style generated insights to help users better understand patterns and trends within their datasets.

The application is built using Python as the core programming language, with Streamlit serving as the web framework. Pandas is used for data processing and manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn handle data visualization. GitHub is used for version control, and the application is deployed live using Streamlit Cloud for seamless online access.

To run the project locally, install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and start the application using `streamlit run app.py`. The project structure is simple and organized, consisting of the main `app.py` file, a `requirements.txt` file, and the `README.md`.

This project is ideal for college mini or major projects, data analytics demonstrations, learning Python with Streamlit, portfolio building, and hackathons or technical presentations. Future enhancements may include AI-powered chat with data (Q&A system), exporting analysis reports as PDF, dashboard saving functionality, user authentication, and cloud database integration.
